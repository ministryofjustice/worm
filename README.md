WORM is a command line tool that helps manage databases and media assets
generated by WordPress between different environments on CloudPlatform.

It is based off the [Laravel-Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) framework.

## Environments

  Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) setup on your local machine
* [PHP Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - generates the /vendor folder with
  autoloader that is required to run app.

## Installation


Download and run `composer install` in this repository's root directory. This
will create a vendor folder. Then run `make install` which compiles the app
into a binary and system links it so that it is available globally on your

You will be prompted to enter your Mac OS password so the system links can be established. You will
also need to have `AWS`, `kubectl`, `cloud-platform` and `php` installed on your command line.
