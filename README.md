WORM is a command line tool that helps manage databases and media assets
generated by WordPress between different environments on CloudPlatform.

It is based off the [Laravel-Zero](https://laravel-zero.com/) framework.

## Environments

WORM targets the following environments, `Local`, `Demo`, `Dev`, `Staging` & `Prod`.

## Features

* Download database or media assets from any environment.
* Upload database or media assets from any environment.
* Check WordPress sites installed on multisite and their blog ids.
* Display wpsecrets `worm status --secrets`
* Display list of sites on multisite cluster `worm listSites`
* Setup AWS Profiles for s3, rds and ecr list for current namespace `worm setup:createProfiles`
* Migrate - `worm migrate <source> <target>` will move the database and s3
  assets from one environment to another. Todo: currently only works with
  staging, dev, demo migrating to local.

## Required

* [AWS
  Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) setup on your local machine
* [PHP Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - generates the /vendor folder with
  autoloader that is required to run app.
* [Authentication to
  CloudPlatforms](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/kubectl-config.html) k8s cluster setup on your local machine

## Installation

Step 1: Download the WORM repository to your local machine, either
via SSH - `git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/worm.git` or
GH - `gh repo clone ministryofjustice/worm`.

Step 2: `cd` into this repository's root directory on your local machine.

Step 3: Install WORM via Composer
Run `composer install`. This will create the required vendor folder.

Step 4: Install WORM globally on your machine
Run `make install` which compiles the app into a binary and
system links it so that it is available globally on your machine. You will be
prompted to enter your Mac OS password so the system links can be established.
You will also need to have `AWS`, `kubectl`, `cloud-platform` and
`php` installed on your command line.

If successfull, you should be able to run `worm` in your terminal window and it
load the worm command options.

Step 5: Setup your AWS profiles
Run `worm create:profiles` in each namespace. This creates a standard and
unique set of aws profiles in your computer's root directory in the `.aws`
folder.

## Quick guide

Make sure you are in the hale-platform repo root on your local machine and
you are in the correct namespace ie `kubens hale-platform-dev`.
